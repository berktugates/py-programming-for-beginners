## Introduction
-------------------------
The purpose of creating this repo is to learn the python language while also enabling others to learn the information I have learned. I'll be sharing basic to advanced code examples over time.
The materials I will share will be in Turkish and English. Below you can find the links to the materials.

Let's write our first Python code!
```py
print("Hello World!")
```
